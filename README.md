#Front-End Capstone: An App for Bettering Yourself

If you're struggling with bad coping mechanisms, poor self-control, or you just aren't making progress on your self-improvement goals, this is the app for you. This Front-End Capstone provides simple tools for having daily interventions with yourself, allowing you to modify your behavior without having to devote as much mental bandwidth to controlling yourself. The app works under the assumption that the user knows what the right decisions are, but has trouble making them in the moment. It allows the user to take their own advice (or keep track of the advice of professionals).

The app helps the user to make better choices by "checking in" with them at specified times and asking them if they're experiencing the beginning of an emotional, physical or behavioral problem. Once the user has specified the problem they are having, the app provides them with a reminder of what they've already learned--advice and ways of seeing the problem meant to alter behavior and promote better coping mechanisms (the kind of advice we get from help-groups and mental health professionals). The hope is that this will better allow the user to take stock of their current state and alter the course of their behavior BEFORE it becomes a real problem. Essentially, it's a mini-self intervention app.

#React Information (Running the App)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
